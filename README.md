> The following table currently (2022.11.01) reflects the default-generated repository for the class and has (mostly) not been customized otherwise.

|Project Directories | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|
|[`/data`](./data) | All project datasets should be stored and documented here. For example, if you work with Common Separated Value (.cvs) datasets, they would stored here and documented in this directory's README.md file. Similarly, if you get data from web APIs, you would document the APIs in the directory's `README.md`.
|[`/docs`](./docs) | All project reports and web documents will be published from this directory. This includes Markdown files (.md), R Markdown files (.Rmd),   HTML files (.html), and so on. The `./docs` directory is the root directory of the website for your project. It will also be used to store all of your design work and project documentation.|
|[`/instructions`](./instructions)| This directory contains the project design brief.  |
|[`/source`](./source) | All for your R source code will be located in this directory. To organize your code, you might also decide to create sub-directories.
| .gitignore | This  file is important. It tells git to ignore all files that are listed therein. Ignoring "non-useful" files will make it *much* easier to work togther in your team. See Freeman and Ross (2019, section 3.6) for details.  |
